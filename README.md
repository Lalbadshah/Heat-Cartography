# Heat-Cartography

A server that recieves data from an embedded device, parses its code and coordinates then generates a heatmap from the data and overlays it on top of a map to generate a result.

#Usage

Use the MasterServer.py 

Install libraries: PIL & a heatmap generating library by https://github.com/chucknthem/heatmap

The SampleClient.py is to simulate input from embedded devices

IP and ports are hardcoded and can be changed

heatmapExample.py only contains the image overlay and heatmapping logic

resultX.png are the sample output images generated by the system
